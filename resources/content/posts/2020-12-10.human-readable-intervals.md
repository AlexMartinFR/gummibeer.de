  I will show you an easy way to write human readable intervals in your Laravel config and everywhere else.
---

Every Laravel application has several configuration values that represent a given amount of seconds or minutes.
Like the `session.lifetime`, `auth.password_timeout`, `queue.connections.*.retry_after` and a lot more.
By default all these values are a single integer like `10800`, some of them even missing the unit in the description.

## Multiplication

I bet that most of you know and have already done the easiest way - replace the single integer with a multiplication like `3 * 60 * 60` which is the same as `10800`.
Another benefit is that you can guess what's the interval as it's `days * minutes * seconds`.
But there are still problems:

1. it requires brain capacity to parse the multiplication
2. not all intervals are seconds - how would you differ between `10 * 60` (10 hours in minutes) and `10 * 60` (10 minutes in seconds)
3. it gets even harder when you need an interval like "2 days 6 hours" in seconds `(2 * 24 * 60 * 60) + (6 * 60 * 60)`

Luckily there's a solution for both issues.

## Carbon Interval

Some time ago [@marcelpociot](https://twitter.com/marcelpociot) posted this [solution on Twitter](https://twitter.com/marcelpociot/status/1176018954986426368).

If you don't know the class already - the [nesbot/carbon](https://github.com/briannesbitt/Carbon) (required by Laravel itself) provides the `\Carbon\CarbonInterval` class ([docs](https://carbon.nesbot.com/docs/#api-interval)).

This class comes with a human readable fluent API to write your interval however you want.
The important part is the magic property `totalSeconds` - similar properties exist for minutes, days and so on.

```php
use Carbon\CarbonInterval;

CarbonInterval::days(2)->hours(6)->totalSeconds;
```

This is helpful in every part of your application - not only the configuration but also the real app code, for example cache TTL, signed URL expiration and wherever you need a given amount of seconds, minutes or other time units.
