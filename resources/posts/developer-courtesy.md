# Developer courtesy

This post was one of the first I planned for my blog.
After I've started with Laravel it didn't took long until I found [spatie](https://spatie.be) and not much longer till my first issues and PRs.
One of the first things I've noticed was that they thank every contributor - regardless how small the changes.
Last year I've took over [astrotomic/laravel-translatable](https://github.com/Astrotomic/laravel-translatable) from [Dimitris Savvopoulos](https://twitter.com/dimsav/status/1140750099875860481).
This was a perfect start for me to try it myself - to thank all contributors as a maintainer.

Right after my first post I've seen a post by Adam about [Open source courtesy](https://webwide.io/threads/open-source-courtesy.600/).
And because I "live" in the amazing, friendly and helpful Laravel universe I was shocked.
This year I have a new chance to make the dev-community a bit more friendly and welcome - in my new job.

## As a Maintainer/Leader

As a leader you have the power to change things in your team.
Others will also look up to you and follow your actions.
So why not use your possibilities and make the world a bit better/friendlier?
And it's easy as two words "Thank you".
Just use it more often - thank contributors for writing issues or their Pull Requests.
And also your team members deserve a thank you from time to time.
Even if it's your all job we are all humans and feel better after recognition.

## As a Contributor/Developer

For sure also you as a "normal" developer can thank your colleagues.
But I also want to talk about something different here.
